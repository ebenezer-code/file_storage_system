## DandLY is a file storage system clone built using NextTS, Tailwind CSS, Convex backend and Clerk for authentication and User Management.
## Software Development Life Cycle
The methodology for this project is a combination of Agile and waterfall. Agile in the development of the web portion of the system because of flexibility and waterfall for the development of the encryption module because of rigidity.
## System Requirements
The system requirements are divided into two: Hardware and software requirements.
Hardware Requirements
•	Intel Core I3 
•	2.5GHz
•	8Gb RAM
•	100GB HDD space

## Software Requirements
•	Windows 10
•	Ubuntu 18.3
•	Mac OS x
•	Fedora 9.0
•	RedHat 8
•	Centos 7

## System Architecture
This project uses a monolithic application structure, in which all parts of an app were written and deployed together - frontend, backend + database. Separate modules are where each of the functionalities is carried out within this monolithic structure. Frontend is built on Next.js and produces an orchestrated user interface. Back-end uses Convex that takes care of the application logic as well as putting interactions with database. The ecosystem utilizes Clerk for strong authentication and authorization making it a very secure access control system. Even though a monolith - is distributed because it will be expected to span multiple servers or services.
This distributed approach enhances the application’s ability to handle higher loads and improve performance while maintaining the simplicity and coherence of a single, unified application.
